<h1>👋About Me Section</h1>
   Hi, my name is Abrar Chowdhury! <br> <br>

   👨‍🎓 I'm in my third year currently as a full-time student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. <br> 
      Focusing mostly on Software Engineering <br> <br>

   💻Currently Learning: C, C++ <br> <br>

   🚗I like to enjoy the small things in life and one of my favorite hobbies is just going on drives and enjoying the ride <br>
     (no, I'm not a car guy by any means). <br> <br>

   🎲Fun Fact: I've memorized the Checkers game pattern needed to win every single game that you start with! <br>
