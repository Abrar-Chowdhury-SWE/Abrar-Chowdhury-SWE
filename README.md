<h1>👋 About Me</h1>
Hi, my name is Abrar Chowdhury! <br><br>

👨‍💻 I'm a recent grad from Rutgers University and I earned my degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science! I focus primarily on software engineering and full-stack development — especially building robust backend systems and clean, scalable interfaces.<br><br>

🛠️ Recently, I interned at Orokii as a Full Stack Software Engineer, where I worked with React, Node.js, and Firebase to build a cryptocurrency payment gateway platform. I’m also currently working as an AI Code Reviewer at Outlier.ai, evaluating LLM-generated code across client projects in Python and Java.<br><br>

📚 Some of my favorite experiences include leading a 16-week tutoring program aligned with Rutgers’ Intro to CS course, building an FM radio transmitter using Java and microcontrollers, and creating a custom shell in C with pipelining, redirection, and memory optimization.<br><br>

🚀 I’m currently expanding my skills with certifications in AWS and Google Cloud, and always looking to contribute to meaningful software projects that combine creativity, systems thinking, and problem-solving.<br><br>

🎲 Fun Fact: I’ve memorized the Checkers pattern that guarantees a win (yes, I take my board games a little too seriously).<br><br>

📫 Let’s connect — I'm open to full-time opportunities starting in 2025!
